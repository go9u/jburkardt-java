      COLLATZ <br> The Collatz Sequence
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COLLATZ</b> is a JAVA routine for computing the
      Collatz sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules for generation of the Collatz sequence are recursive.
      If <b>T</b> is the current entry of the sequence, (<b>T</b> is
      assumed to be a positive integer), then the next
      entry, <b>U</b> is determined as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          if <b>T</b> is 1, terminate the sequence;
        </li>
        <li>
          else if <b>T</b> is even, <b>U</b> = <b>T</b>/2.
        </li>
        <li>
          else (if <b>T</b> is odd and not 1), <b>U</b> = 3*<b>T</b>+1;
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Collatz sequence seems to be finite for every
      starting point, this has not been proved.  Over the range of
      starting values that have been examined, a great irregularity
      has been observed in the number of entries in the corresponding
      sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Collatz sequence is also known as the "hailstone" sequence or
      the "3n+1" sequence.
